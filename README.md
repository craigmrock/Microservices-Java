# Microservices-Java
Java project with microservices


Context: I watched a Pluralsight video on microservices and felt inspired to learn more about it – like this the way to get things done.
Action: I started building a program and added to it; so here there are 5 resources plus a Discovery service and a Gateway service.
Result: I immediately wanted to take all of my projects and turn them into microservices…or take several projects and turn them into one microservice project.
Reflection: At a time in my learning where the knowledge seems endless, I’m really grateful for discovering and working with microservices when I did. It has helped me see a path that I was thinking should be there somewhere.
